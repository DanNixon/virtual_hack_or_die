## Things

### Pocket C.H.I.P.

A Pocket C.H.I.P. from the Kickstarter campaign.
See [here](https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-new).

### Batteries

- ~10 18650 lithium-ion cells (salvaged from an old laptop battery pack)
- Several 1 cell lithium polymer cells (previously used for small quadcopters, most have the "Hubsan" connector, some have JST)
- Certainly more, but I don't have all the details of them to hand...

### HTC Desire

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Desire) phone.
Pretty good condition.
Not sure what software is on this, IIRC it is still stock.

### Galaxy Nexus

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus) phone.
In pretty good condition, comes with an Otter Box case that is rather worse off.
Supports up to Andoird 4.3 officially, not sure what I last loaded onto it.

### Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad

[This](https://1byone.com/ultra-slim-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard.html) keyboard.
US layout.
Rechargeable.
In good condition and works fine.
Not used in a long time and I have plenty of other keyboards that are nicer to type on.

### Bluetooth keyboard

[This](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Motorola-ATRIX-XOOM-Universal-Bluetooth-Wireless-Full-Size-Keyboard-SJYN0700A/264429560501) keyboard.
US layout.
Takes 2xAA.
Not used in several many years.
Pretty sure I got this to take lecture notes on my phone in my first year at uni.
Like I say, several many years.
