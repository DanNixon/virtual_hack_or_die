# Dan's Virtual Hack or Die

Things that I still have but want rid of.
All of it is going for free.

## Things

### Pocket C.H.I.P.

A Pocket C.H.I.P. from the Kickstarter campaign.
See [here](https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-new).

### Batteries

- ~10 18650 lithium-ion cells (salvaged from an old laptop battery pack)
- Several 1 cell lithium polymer cells (previously used for small quadcopters, most have the "Hubsan" connector, some have JST)
- Certainly more, but I don't have all the details of them to hand...

### Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad

[This](https://1byone.com/ultra-slim-wireless-bluetooth-keyboard.html) keyboard.
US layout.
Rechargeable.
In good condition and works fine.
Not used in a long time and I have plenty of other keyboards that are nicer to type on.
