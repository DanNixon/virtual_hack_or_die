# Dan's Virtual Hack or Die

Things that I still have but want rid of.
All of it is going for free.
Assume that ever thing that is listed now is still available.

If you want a thing, get in touch with me via one of (in order of how quickly I
will reply):
- [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@dannixon:matrix.org)
- [GH Issues](https://github.com/DanNixon/virtual_hack_or_die/issues/new)
- Email/mailing list

## Things

### Batteries

- Several 1 cell lithium polymer cells (previously used for small quadcopters, most have the "Hubsan" connector, some have JST)
- Certainly more, but I don't have all the details of them to hand...
